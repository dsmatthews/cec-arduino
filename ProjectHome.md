## Overview ##

This is an Arduino library which implements the HDMI v1.3a CEC wire protocol which allows communication with HDMI CEC capable devices.  A typical usage scenario would be a Home Theater PC environment which uses HDMI but does not support CEC.  This would allow the HTPC to communicate with other HDMI CEC equipment.
